Here are some engaging station activities based on the provided Pygame script for your high school Intro to Python Programming class. Each station is designed to take between 5 and 15 minutes, and some are paired or partner activities while others are individual tasks.

### Station 1: Code Walkthrough (Individual)
**Objective:** Understand the structure of the Pygame script.
- **Activity:** Students will read through the provided Pygame script and identify the purpose of each function (e.g., `init_game`, `handle_events`, `draw_text`). They will write a brief summary of what each function does and how it contributes to the overall program.
- **Materials:** Printed copies of the script, highlighters, and paper for notes.

### Station 2: Modify Text (Partner Activity)
**Objective:** Experiment with text properties in Pygame.
- **Activity:** In pairs, students will modify the text displayed in the script. They can change the content of the text strings, adjust the font sizes, colors, and positions. After making changes, they will run the program to see the effects of their modifications.
- **Materials:** Computers with the Pygame environment set up, printed copies of the script.

### Station 3: Create a New Function (Individual)
**Objective:** Practice writing functions in Python.
- **Activity:** Students will write a new function that draws a rectangle on the screen. They should define the function to take parameters for position, size, and color. After writing the function, they will call it in the `main` function to display the rectangle.
- **Materials:** Computers with the Pygame environment set up, printed copies of the script.

### Station 4: Event Handling Exploration (Partner Activity)
**Objective:** Understand event handling in Pygame.
- **Activity:** In pairs, students will modify the `handle_events` function to add new event handling. For example, they could add functionality to change the background color when a specific key is pressed. They will test their changes and discuss how event handling works in Pygame.
- **Materials:** Computers with the Pygame environment set up, printed copies of the script.

### Station 5: Config Module Creation (Individual)
**Objective:** Learn about modular programming.
- **Activity:** Students will create a new `config.py` module that includes constants for window dimensions, colors, and title. They will then modify the main script to import and use these constants. This will help them understand how to organize code better.
- **Materials:** Computers with the Pygame environment set up, printed copies of the script, and a template for the `config.py` file.

### Station 6: Frame Rate Experimentation (Individual)
**Objective:** Understand frame rates and their impact on game performance.
- **Activity:** Students will modify the `FPS` value in the `config` module and observe how it affects the smoothness of the program when running. They will document their observations and discuss the importance of frame rates in game development.
- **Materials:** Computers with the Pygame environment set up, printed copies of the script.

### Station 7: Add a New Feature (Partner Activity)
**Objective:** Collaborate to enhance the program.
- **Activity:** In pairs, students will brainstorm and implement a new feature, such as adding a button that changes the text when clicked or implementing a simple scoring system. They will present their feature to the class after completing it.
- **Materials:** Computers with the Pygame environment set up, printed copies of the script.

### Station 8: Debugging Challenge (Individual)
**Objective:** Develop debugging skills.
- **Activity:** Provide students with a modified version of the script that contains intentional bugs (e.g., incorrect variable names, syntax errors). Students will work individually to identify and fix the bugs, then run the program to ensure it works correctly.
- **Materials:** Computers with the Pygame environment set up, printed copies of the buggy script.

### Conclusion
These stations will provide a mix of individual and collaborative activities that reinforce key concepts in Python programming and Pygame. Adjust the timing and complexity of each station based on your students' skill levels and familiarity with the material.
