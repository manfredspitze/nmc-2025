In JavaScript, functions can be categorized into two main types: **named functions** and **anonymous functions**. Here’s a simple explanation of the differences between them, along with their advantages and disadvantages.

### Named Functions

A **named function** is a function that has a name. You define it using the `function` keyword followed by the name you want to give it. Here’s an example:

```javascript
function greet() {
    console.log("Hello, world!");
}

greet(); // Calling the named function
```

### Anonymous Functions

An **anonymous function**, on the other hand, does not have a name. It is often used as a function expression and can be assigned to a variable, passed as an argument to another function, or used in other ways. Here’s an example:

```javascript
const greet = function() {
    console.log("Hello, world!");
};

greet(); // Calling the anonymous function
```

### Key Differences

1. **Naming**:
   - **Named Function**: Has a name (e.g., `greet`).
   - **Anonymous Function**: Does not have a name.

2. **Usage**:
   - **Named Function**: Can be called from anywhere in its scope, even before it is defined (due to hoisting).
   - **Anonymous Function**: Can only be called after it has been defined (it is not hoisted).

### Advantages of Each Type

#### Advantages of Named Functions:
- **Readability**: Named functions can make your code easier to read and understand because the name describes what the function does.
- **Debugging**: When an error occurs, the stack trace will show the name of the function, making it easier to identify where the problem is.
- **Hoisting**: Named functions are hoisted, meaning you can call them before they are defined in the code.

#### Advantages of Anonymous Functions:
- **Flexibility**: Anonymous functions are often used in situations where you need a function for a short period, such as callbacks or event handlers.
- **Encapsulation**: They can help keep your code organized by limiting the scope of the function to where it is needed.
- **Immediate Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE)**: Anonymous functions can be used to create IIFEs, which are functions that run immediately after they are defined. This is useful for creating a private scope.

### Example of an Anonymous Function as a Callback

Here’s an example of using an anonymous function as a callback:

```javascript
setTimeout(function() {
    console.log("This message appears after 2 seconds!");
}, 2000);
```

In this case, the anonymous function is used as a callback for the `setTimeout` function, which executes it after a delay.

### Summary

In summary, the main difference between named and anonymous functions in JavaScript is that named functions have a name and can be called before they are defined, while anonymous functions do not have a name and can only be called after they are defined. Each type has its own advantages, and the choice between them often depends on the specific use case and coding style.
