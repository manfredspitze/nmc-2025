Here are the most important points to remember about arrow functions in JavaScript:

1. Arrow functions are a more concise syntax for writing functions. They use the => syntax instead of the function keyword.

2. Arrow functions automatically bind the this value to the surrounding lexical scope, rather than the dynamic scope like regular functions. This can help avoid common issues with the this keyword.

3. Arrow functions are best suited for short, one-line functions. For longer, multi-line functions, the traditional function syntax may be more readable.

4. Arrow functions do not have their own this, arguments, super, or new.target values. These values are inherited from the enclosing scope.

5. Arrow functions cannot be used as constructors with the new keyword. They also cannot be used as generator functions with the * syntax.

6. The return keyword can be omitted from arrow functions if the function body is a single expression. The expression will be implicitly returned.

For example:

$$
// Traditional function
let square = function(x) {
  return x * x;
}

// Arrow function
let square = (x) => x * x;
$$
