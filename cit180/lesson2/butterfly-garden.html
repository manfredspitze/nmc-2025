		<h1>Creating your own Butterfly Garden</h1>
		<h2>Butterfly Bush</h2>
		<p>A butterfly bush is a shrub that's typically covered in 
		butterflies all summer long. It is an easy-care shrub that features fragrant flowers in 
		shades of blue, purple, and white. </p>
		<p>If your butterfly bush starts to get big, prune it back in winter or early spring.
		You can cut it almost all the way down to the ground.</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Name:</strong> Buddleia selections<br>
			<strong>Growing conditions:</strong> Full sun and moist, well-drained soil<br>
			<strong>Size:</strong>Up to 10 feet tall and 15 feet wide, depending on type<br>
			<strong>Zones:</strong> 5-9, depending on type<br>
			<strong>Grow it with: </strong>Mexican sunflower; this annual's bold orange 
			flowers look great against just about any butterfly bush.
		</p>
		<h2>Salvia</h2>
		<p>There's a salvia for every garden: some are tall, others are short. Some have blue 
		or purple blooms, and others have red, orange, or pink flowers.</p>
		<p>While you might have trouble picking a salvia, the butterflies won't -- they'll reliably 
		flock to it every summer.</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Name:</strong> Salvia 'May Night'<br>
			<strong>Growing Conditions:</strong> Full sun and well-drained soil <br>
			<strong>Size: </strong>Up to 3 feet tall and 1 foot wide <br>
			<strong>Zones:</strong> 4-9 Grow it with: Coreopsis for a long-blooming, no-fail blue-and-yellow combination.
			</p>
		<h2>Phlox</h2>
		<p>Phlox bears beautiful clusters of red, pink, lavender, salmon, or white 
		blooms throughout the summer. Their lovely scent delights our noses as much 
		as their nectar delights hungry butterflies.</p>
		<p>Phlox can be troubled by a disease called powdery mildew. Look for 
		disease-resistant varieties.</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Name:</strong> Phlox paniculata<br>
			<strong>Growing Conditions:</strong> Full sun and well-drained soil<br>
			<strong>Size:</strong> Up to 4 feet tall and 1 foot wide<br>
			<strong>Zones:</strong> 4-8<br>
			<strong>Grow it with:</strong>Purple coneflower -- the two plants thrive in the same growing conditions 
			and visually complement each other.
		</p>
		<h2>Aster</h2>
		<p>A top plant for the fall garden, aster is a heavy bloomer with colorful 
		flowers in shades of blue, purple, pink, red, and white. </p>
		<p>Aster does double duty: The blossoms supply nectar for fall butterflies, and 
		Pearl Crescent caterpillars feed on the plant's leaves.</p>
		<p>Look for newer named varieties of asters; they're often more disease 
		resistant and compact.</p>
 		<p>
			<strong>Name:</strong> Aster selections<br>
			<strong>Growing Conditions:</strong> Full sun and moist, well-drained soil<br>
			<strong>Size:</strong> Up to 5 feet tall and 2 feet wide, depending on type<br>
			<strong>Zones:</strong> 3-8, depending on type<br>
			<strong>Grow it with:</strong> Bloody geranium -- this spring- and summer-blooming perennial develops 
			bright red fall foliage that looks great with colorful aster flowers.
