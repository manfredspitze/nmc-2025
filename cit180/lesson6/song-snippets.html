    <h2>I Am A Rock lyrics</h2>
    <p>A winter's day<br>
      In a deep and dark<br>
      December<br>
      I am alone<br>
      Gazing from my window to the streets below<br>
      On a freshly fallen silent shroud of snow<br>
      I am a rock<br>
      I am an island</p>

  <h2>Kodachrome lyrics</h2>
  <p> They give us those nice bright colors<br>
    They give us the greens of summers<br>
    Makes you think all the world's a sunny day, Oh yeah<br>
    I got a Nikon camera<br>
    I love to take a photograph<br>
    So mama don't take my Kodachrome away</p>

  <h2>The Boxer lyrics</h2>
  <p>I am just a poor boy<br>
    Though my story's seldom told<br>
    I have squandered my resistance <br>
    For a pocket full of mumbles<br>
    Such are promises<br>
    All lies and jests<br>
    Still a man hears what he wants to hear<br>
    And disregards the rest</p>

  <h2>America lyrics</h2>
  <p>It took me four days<br>
    To hitch-hike from Saginaw.<br>
    &quot;I've come to look for America.&quot;</p>

  <h2>Bridge Over Troubled Water lyrics</h2>
  <p>When you're weary, feeling small,<br>
    When tears are in your eyes<br>
    I will dry them all<br>
    I'm on your side<br>
    Oh when times get rough<br>
    And friends just can't be found</p>

  <h2>Background on the Duo</h2>	
  <p>"Simon & Garfunkel were an American folk-rock duo consisting of singer-songwriter Paul Simon and singer Art Garfunkel. One of the best-selling music groups of the 1960s, their biggest hits—including "The Sound of Silence" (1965), "Mrs. Robinson" (1968), "The Boxer" (1969), and "Bridge over Troubled Water" (1970)—reached number one on singles charts worldwide."</p>
	<p>"The duo met in elementary school in Queens, New York in 1953 where they learned to harmonize together and began writing original material. By 1957, under the name Tom & Jerry, the teenagers had their first minor success with "Hey Schoolgirl", a song imitating their idols the Everly Brothers. In 1963, aware of a growing public interest in folk music, they regrouped and were signed to Columbia Records as Simon & Garfunkel. Their debut Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M. sold poorly, and they once again disbanded; Simon returned to a solo career, this time in England. In June 1965, a new version of "The Sound of Silence" overdubbed with electric guitar and drums became a major U.S. AM radio hit, reaching number one on the Billboard Hot 100. They reunited to release a second studio album Sounds of Silence and tour colleges nationwide. On their third release, Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme (1966), the duo assumed more creative control. Their music was featured in the 1967 film The Graduate, giving them further exposure. Their next album Bookends (1968) topped the Billboard 200 chart[2] and included the number-one single "Mrs. Robinson" from the film."</p>
