	<h1>A Windows Alternative</h1>
	<section class="columns">

	  <p class="intro">Are you a Windows user who&apos;s tired of constantly having to download batch after batch of updates that more often than not only seem to break your operating system?  Are you looking for a less expensive alternative to Microsoft Windows?  Do you want to have more control over the behavior and appearance of your computer&apos;s OS?</p>

	  <p>If you answered &quot;Yes!&quot; to any of the questions above, then maybe you should consider giving a Linux distribution such as <strong>Linux Mint</strong> a spin.</p>

	  <h3>Linux? What is Linux?</h3>

	  <p>Linux is an open-source operating system that is widely used on servers, supercomputers, and embedded systems. Known for its stability, security, and flexibility, Linux is often used by developers, system administrators, and power users.</p>

	  <p>Linux is available in many different distributions, each with its own set of features and tools, but they all share the same underlying Linux kernel.</p>

	  <h3>Why Choose Linux Mint?</h3>

	  <p>In short, Linux Mint is a distribution that&apos;s &quot;easy to use, fast and comfortable.&quot; (Source: <a href="https://www.linuxmint.com/">linuxmint.com</a> home page)</p>

	  <h3>Out of The Box (OOTB)</h3>

	  <p>&quot;Everything just works &quot;Out Of The Box&quot;, without the need to configure anything or to install extra applications. It&apos;s ready to go. Although it&apos;s very configurable, everything is set and tuned nicely by default and no unnecessary questions are asked.&quot;  (Source: <a href="https://www.linuxmint.com/">linuxmint.com</a> home page)</p>

	  <h3>KISS</h3>

	  <p>&quot;It&apos;s very easy to use. It features an intuitive desktop and adopts KISS principles. Anyone can rapidly feel at home and use Linux Mint. User experience, workflow and comfort is key.&quot;  (Source: <a href="https://www.linuxmint.com/">linuxmint.com</a> home page)</p>

	  <h3>Free &amp; Open Source</h3>

	  <p>&quot;It is completely free of cost and almost all of its components are open source. Linux Mint stands on the shoulder of giants, since it is based on Debian and Ubuntu.&quot;  (Source: <a href="https://www.linuxmint.com/">linuxmint.com</a> home page)</p>

	  <h3>Summary</h3>

	  <p>Another interesting thing about Linux is that you can run a Linux distribution on your computer without installing it, just to see if the distro and all its features are compatible with your machine.</p>

	  <p>While I&apos;ve tried many different Linux distributions over the years, I prefer Linux Mint because it&apos;s stable and easy to configure.  The user interface is clean and professional-looking, and it&apos;s obvious the Mint development team has put a lot of time and effort into building a distribution that looks nice, runs smoothly, and is a snap to use and maintain.</p>
