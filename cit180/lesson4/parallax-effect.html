      <h1>Landslide</h1>
      <p> I took my love, I took it down.&nbsp;
        Climbed a mountain and I turned around. <br>
        And I saw my reflection in the snow covered hills.
        'Til the landslide brought it down. <br>
        <br>
        Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love?
        Can the child within my heart rise above? <br>
        Can I sail through the changin' ocean tides?
        Can I handle the seasons of my life?<br>
        <br>
        Well, I've been afraid of changin cause I've built my life around you. <br>
        But time makes you bolder.  Even children get older.&nbsp;
        And I'm getting older, too <br>
        <br>
        Well, I've been afraid of changin cause I've built my life around you. <br>
        But time makes you bolder.  Even children get older. <br>
        And I'm getting older, too.  Oh, I'm getting older, too<br>
        <br>
        I took my love, I took it down.
        I climbed a mountain and I turned around. <br>
        And if you see my reflection in the snow covered hills.
        Well the landslide will bring it down.<br>
        <br>
        And if you see my reflection in the snow covered hills.&nbsp; <br>
        Well the landslide will bring it down
        Oh, the landslide will bring it down</p>

      <h1>Gypsy</h1>
      <p>So I'm back to the velvet underground.    Back to the floor that I love. <br>
        To a room with some lace and paper flowers. <br>
        Back to the gypsy that I was.  
        To the gypsy that I was<br>
        <br>
        And it all comes down to you. <br>
        Well, you know that it does, well lightning strikes maybe once, maybe twice. <br>
        Oh and it lights up the night.&nbsp;
        And you see your gypsy. 
        You see your gypsy<br>
        <br>
        To the gypsy that remains&nbsp;
        Her face says freedom with a little fear&nbsp; <br>
        I have no fear	I have only love
        And if I was a child. <br>
        And the child was enough.
        Enough for me to love. 
        Enough to love<br>
        <br>
        She is dancing away from you now.
        She was just a wish. <br>
        She was just a wish.
        And her memory is all that is left for you now. <br>
        You see your gypsy, oh. 
        You see your gypsy<br>
        <br>
        Ooh ooh, oh oh, oh oh oh<br>
        <br>
        Goodness strikes. 
        Maybe once, maybe twice.
        And it all comes down to you.&nbsp; <br>
        Ooh oh, and it all comes down to you.
        Lightning strikes. 
        Maybe once, maybe twice (oh)<br>
        I still see your bright eyes, bright eyes.
        (And it all comes down to you)</p>
