Here are some ideas for how you could use XML in your semester web development final project:

1. **Data Storage and Retrieval**: You could use XML to store and retrieve data for your web application. For example, you could store product information, user profiles, or configuration settings in an XML file and then use JavaScript to parse and display the data on your web pages.

2. **Data Exchange**: You could use XML to exchange data between your web application and other systems or services. For example, you could use XML to communicate with a web service that provides weather data or stock quotes.

3. **Configuration Management**: You could use XML to manage the configuration settings for your web application. For example, you could store database connection details, email server settings, or other configuration parameters in an XML file and then use your application to read and apply these settings.

4. **Content Management**: You could use XML to manage the content of your web pages. For example, you could store the content of your web pages in an XML file and then use a server-side language like PHP or Node.js to dynamically generate the HTML pages based on the XML data.

5. **Document Transformation**: You could use XML to transform the structure and format of your web content. For example, you could use XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations) to convert an XML document into HTML, PDF, or other formats.

6. **Web Services**: You could use XML to create a web service that provides data or functionality to other applications. For example, you could create an XML-based API that allows other developers to access your application's data or functionality.

7. **Syndication**: You could use XML to create RSS or Atom feeds that allow users to subscribe to updates from your web application. For example, you could create an XML feed that provides updates on new products or blog posts.
