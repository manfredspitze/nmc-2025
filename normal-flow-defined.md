In HTML5, the normal flow of a web page refers to the default way that elements are positioned and laid out on the page. This is the way the browser arranges elements on the page without any additional CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) positioning or layout properties being applied.

The normal flow follows these basic principles:

1. Block-level elements: These elements, such as `<div>`, `<p>`, `<h1>`, etc., are stacked vertically, one after the other, from top to bottom.

2. Inline elements: These elements, such as `<span>`, `<a>`, `<img>`, etc., are placed within the flow of a block-level element, typically from left to right.

3. Positioning: By default, elements are positioned according to their place in the HTML structure, without any explicit positioning properties applied.

4. Spacing: Elements in the normal flow will have default spacing, such as margins and padding, as defined by the browser's default styles or any CSS rules applied.

In summary, the normal flow is the default way HTML elements are laid out on a web page, without any additional CSS positioning or layout properties being applied. This provides a consistent and predictable way for the browser to display the content on the page.
